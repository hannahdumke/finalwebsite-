                        <h3>Papilio glaucus</h3> 
                        <p>The eastern tiger swallowtail, is a species of butterfly native to eastern North America. It is one of the most familiar butterflies in the eastern United States,ranging north to southern Ontario, Canada, and is common in many different habitats. It flies from spring until fall, during which it produces two to three broods. Adults feed on the nectar of many species of flowers, mostly from those of the families Apocynaceae, Asteraceae, and Fabaceae. P. glaucus has a wingspan measuring 7.9 to 14 cm (3.1 to 5.5 in). The male is yellow with four black "tiger stripes" on each forewing. Females may be either yellow or black, making them dimorphic. The yellow morph is similar to the male, but with a conspicuous band of blue spots along the hindwing, while the dark morph is almost completely black.

                            The green eggs are laid singly on plants of the families Magnoliaceae and Rosaceae.Young caterpillars are brown and white; older ones are green with two black, yellow, and blue eyespots on the thorax. The caterpillar will turn brown prior to pupating. It will reach a length of 5.5 centimetres (2.2 in). The chrysalis varies from a whitish color to dark brown. Hibernation occurs in this stage in locations with cold winter months.
                            
                            The eastern tiger swallowtail is the state butterfly of Alabama (as well as state mascot), Delaware, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina,[6] and is the state insect of Virginia. “worms” changing into winged creatures before their eyes similarly awed the ancients. The Greek word ‘psyche’ is interwoven with the concept of spirit or breath, an animating life force in humans, and other animals. From Greek mythology, Psyche was the embodiment and deification of the human soul. She is often depicted in ancient statues and tile mosaics as a beautiful young woman with butterfly wings. </p>
